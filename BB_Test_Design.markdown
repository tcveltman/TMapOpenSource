**What is test design**

One of the most important goals of testing is a clear advise on quality and risk in such a way that all the parties involved gain confidence in the product. 
To be able to do this, a tester has to gather information on system behavior. One of the main tools in gathering information is the executing test cases. The results of those cases give information on the system behavior. The main questions are: Which testcases? 
How many? And how do we get those cases? In answering those questions test design is indispensible. 

Designing the right set of [test cases](http://www.tmap.net/wiki/test-cases) is the essential link between the test strategy and the implementation of the test strategy -  the tests that are executed. 
See the picture below for the link between the relevant terms in test design:
