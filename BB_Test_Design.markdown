***Test Design***

**What is test design?**

One of the most important goals of testing is a clear advise on quality and risk in such a way that all the parties involved gain confidence in the product. 
To be able to do this, a tester has to gather information on system behavior. One of the main tools in gathering information is the executing [test cases](http://www.tmap.net/wiki/test-cases). The results of those cases give information on the system behavior. The main questions are: Which [test cases](http://www.tmap.net/wiki/test-cases)? 
How many? And how do we get those cases? In answering those questions test design is indispensible. 

Designing the right set of [test cases](http://www.tmap.net/wiki/test-cases) is the essential link between the [test strategy](http://www.tmap.net/building-blocks/test-strategy) and the implementation of the test strategy -  the tests that are executed. 
See the picture below for the link between the relevant terms in test design:

Implementing the test strategy
</p>

The terms and conditions of the [assignment](www.tmap.net) determine the time and the effort available for testing.  In the [Product Risk Analysis (PRA)](www.tmap.net) is determined which parts of the system are most important to test and should be tested more thouroughly. In the [test strategy](www.tmap.net) an overview is made of the whole test and how the testing effort is divided between different test varieties to cover all the risks most efficiently. The parts of the test object that are under test and the thouroughness that is used when testing those parts determine the coverage over the test. 

The test strategy has to be translated to test cases to implement the test strategy. In many cases, the implementation of the test strategy has to be demonstrated. 

How can we design the testcase? This depends on a couple of factors: 

- The coverage needed
- The test basis -  information on system behavior on which the test cases are based. 
- The way the software development process is organized (for instance waterfall vs. Agile)
- The knowledge and experience of the people involved
- The time and budget available to execute the tests
